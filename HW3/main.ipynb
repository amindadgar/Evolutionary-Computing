    "So to represent a chromsome `1+3×(3+3×2)+3` bits are requierd. The first `1` is $d_{model}$, then in the clause `3×(1+3×1)+3`, the first `3` is showing three possible transform layers. In the paranthesis the first `3` is showing the bit for attention head count and normalization layers then the `3` in multiplication is the count of possible hyperparameters in FFN layer (we could have 2 FFN layer in a transformer) and the last `3` in the equation is the final FFN layer for the network. So `31` bits will be used."

After combining and finding the first level architecture for the chromsome, then the second level will be a population based combination (more than two parents) and for the third level again we will assume the same parts of the parent chromsomes as multiple chromsome. To find out more each method is explained well in subsections below\n",
